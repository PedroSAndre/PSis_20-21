# Project of systems programing - 2020/2021

## How to run
To compile on Linux, just do `<make All>`. This will generate 3 .out files, one for the local server, other for the auth server and, finnaly, one for the test app. The test app requires no input arguments, while the auth server requires the PORT it will run on and the local server needs the IP and PORT (separated by space, in this order).
